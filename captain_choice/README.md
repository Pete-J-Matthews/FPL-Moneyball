## Captain Choice

Each week the user can pick a player to be captain who will have their points doubled for that gameweek. The captain of choice can be chosen freely but is locked at the start of the first fixture.

According to previous winner Joshua Bull who took a [mathmatical approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzEuweGrHvc) there are 4 key varaibles which are order as below:

1: Fixture Difficulty
2: Home or Away
3: Form (Performance in last 4 games)
4: Player price 

This code aims to evaluate these stats (retrieved from the FPL-API) for a given set of players and select a captain based on the above mentioned variables.
