The ultimate aim of this project is to create a program that will pick the best fanatasy premier league team each week to acheive the maximum points possible.

I've broken down the core quesitons below which I aim to program answers for individually before combining there code together:

#### Captain
- Which player should I captain (player gets double points that week)?

#### Transfers

- Which players should I transfer and when?

#### Budget Managment
- Which is the best combination of players that can be bought within the budget?

#### Chip Management
- When is it best to use the lifeline chips (Wildcard, Freehit, Bench Boost & Triple Captain)
